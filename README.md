ctrlp-ssh
============


SYNOPSIS
----------
You can do SSH to a server via ctrlp.vim interface using this plugin.
Note that this plugin is a ctrlp.vim extension and it requires a runner (*tmux* is currently only supported).


PREMISE
----------
First, I believe you're a user of a great Vim plugin [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim).
Otherwise, you need to install it before start installing this plugin.
Second, this plugin requires tmux to open a new SSH window.


INSTALLATION
----------
If you use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git) you can install this plugin using following Vim command:

    :BundleInstall tacahiroy/ctrlp-ssh

In addition, don't forget put a line `Bundle 'tacahiroy/ctrlp-ssh'` into your _.vimrc_.

If you use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), you can do install this plugin with these commands:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tacahiroy/ctrlp-ssh.git

You don't use either plugin management systems, copy _autoload_ and _plugin_ directory to your _.vim_ directory.


CONFIGURATION
----------
You need to make this plugin available as a ctrlp.vim extension. Please add *ssh* to a variable `g:ctrlp_extensions`.

    let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['ssh']

Or if you already use other ctrlp.vim extensions you need to do like this:

    let g:ctrlp_extensions = [ 'funky', 'ssh' ]

Then restart Vim and you can use `:CtrlPSSH` command.

It might be useful mapping like:

    nnoremap <Leader>fs :CtrlPSSH<Cr>
