ctrlp-ssh
============


SYNOPSIS
----------
You can do SSH to a server via ctrlp.vim interface using this plugin.
Note that this plugin is a ctrlp.vim extension and it requires a runner (*tmux* is currently only supported).

![ctrlp-ssh][1]


PREMISE
----------
First, I believe you're a user of a great Vim plugin [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim).
Otherwise, you must install it before start using this plugin.
Second, this plugin requires tmux to open a new SSH window for now.


INSTALLATION
----------
### [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
```vim
    :PluginInstall tacahiroy/ctrlp-ssh
```

In addition, don't forget put a line `Plugin 'tacahiroy/ctrlp-ssh'` into your _.vimrc_.

### [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
```sh
    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone git://github.com/tacahiroy/ctrlp-ssh.git
```

If you don't use either plugin management systems, copy _autoload_ and _plugin_ directory to your _.vim_ directory.


CONFIGURATION
----------
After finished the install process, you may restart Vim and then you can use `:CtrlPSSH` command.

It's useful to define a key mapping like this:
```vim
    nnoremap <Leader>fs :CtrlPSSH<Cr>
```
