==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*ctrlp-ssh-intro*

ctrl-ssh is an extension of ctrlp.vim.
This depends on tmux to open a new SSH window currently.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*ctrlp-ssh-commands*

This plugin provides just one command named |:CtrlPSSH| that lists hosts you
can SSH.

						*ctrlp-ssh-:CtrlPSSH*
:CtrlPSSH

It should be useful to define a key mapping for this command like this: 
>
	nnoremap <Leader>fs :CtrlPSSH<Cr>
<

==============================================================================
KEY MAPPINGS					*ctrlp-ssh-key-mappings*

You can open a new SSH session with a new window (like tab in tmux), vertical /
horizontal split pane.
Here's default key mappings:

<Cr> or <C-t>			into a new window
<C-x> or <C-Cr> or <C-s>	into a horizontal split pane
<C-v>				into a vertical split pane

Basically, these key mappings depend on ctrlp.vim's mappings, so you can
change these keys to others using |g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings|.
Note that configurations in |g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings| affect ctrlp.vim world
widely.


==============================================================================
SETTINGS					*ctrlp-ssh-settings*
You can customise the behaviour of |ctrlp-ssh| using these variables.


						*g:ctrlp_ssh_server_list_file*
This is the path to known_hosts file or something similar.
If you would not like to specify $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts file, then you can
specify a file which includes a host name in each line.
By default, this is set known_hosts file located in your home directory.
>
	let g:ctrlp_ssh_server_list_file = $HOME . '/.ssh/known_hosts'
<

						*g:ctrlp_ssh_keep_ctrlp_window*
If this is set to 1, |ctrlp-ssh| keeps ctrlp window opening after you select a host.
Using this you can open SSH connection one after another.
In this case, to close the window, please note that you need to press <Esc>,
<C-c> or <C-g> by default.
(default: 0)
>
	let g:ctrlp_ssh_keep_ctrlp_window = 1
<

						*g:ctrlp_ssh_runner*
This is a runner which opens SSH windows.
Currently, only the default value 'tmux' can be specified.
(default: 'tmux')
>
	let g:ctrlp_ssh_runner = 'tmux'
<
